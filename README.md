Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass and they wanted a system to provide online driver training, practice tests, and on-the-road trainig. The system needed to allow data access online from any device, handle reservations for driving lessons, track user
activities, manage different user roles and permissions, and ensure compliance with the DMV updates. It also required web-based interface with specific design elements.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well in capturing detailed requirements from the client, ensuring all aspects of their needs were documented. Also, I effectively planted the project schedule, organizing tasks by dependancy and importance.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the UML diagrams. I think the UML digrams that I provided could include more details that would help capture the full picture of various processes happening during implementation.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by actively listening during the interview and recieveing answers the clarifying questions. I implemented thse needs into the system design by ensuring features like online reservations, user activity tracking, 
and involving access were included. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the system is functional, user-frienddly, and meets client's expectations.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software,I focus on understanding the client's requirements, creating detailed use cse and activity diagrams, and involving stakeholders in the design process. In the future, I would
like prototyping and user testing to gather feedback early and iteratively improve the system design.
